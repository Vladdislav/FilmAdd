# FilmAdd
This is my Project
The goal of the project is to create a Xamarin application to tag viewed movies and save them to the library of viewed movies. 
I would also like to make a parser to collect titles, ratings, descriptions, actors, directors, etc., then combine the data and output it as a Film object.
The most important thing is that the application has a SearchBar to search for movies.
There was such a desire due to the fact that it is already difficult for me to check in my Samsung Notes whether I watched the movie or not.
